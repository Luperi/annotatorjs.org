Scholars, bring us your ancient, worn, and insightful annotations.  We have the [tools](http://annotatorjs.org/) to help you collect and connect digital knowledge. Together we can create and curate the best that has been thought and said online.

As a community, we embrace openness.  Our source code will always be libre, our standards compliant, and our knowledge free.  From Cambridge, [USA](http://openvideoannotation.org/) to Cambridge [UK](http://okfn.org/), from [California](http://hypothes.is/) to [Vienna](http://annotorious.org), we are working together to annotate everything -- text, images, PDFs, maps, and videos -- you find online.

If you are a developer, designer, or scholar, we need your help.  If you wish to get involved, please join the conversation about [software](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/annotator-dev) or [scholarship](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/humanities-dev).  

Development of Annotator is made possible by the Open Knowledge Foundation, Hypothes.is, and the Shuttleworth Foundation
